## Basic Task List Application

This is a simple task list web based system using PHP programming language. Here i have used Laravel for rapid development and SQLite Database for serverless.

## System Workflow
	
A user comes to this site and then he can see Task list. He can add more task from add task with providing task title and task description.
After create a task he can see that task in task list. User can edit existing task and can delete task.

## Program Workflow

For rapid development just setup laravel php framework. Then create a sqlite database under database directory. Set write permission to perform operation.
In .env or database config file set sqlite as a default database & set sqlite database path in connection setion with sqlite driver.
Create a resource route, Model and Controller to perform Add new task, Show all task, Edit task and Delete task. Go to url and see your application is working perfectly.
